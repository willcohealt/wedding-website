		  	  <div className="info"> The Pied Piper ferry out of Falmouth is our favorite option for the weekend. With a bar onboard and service directly into downtown Edgartown, this is Sarah and Will's preferred method of arriving to the island. </div>
		  	  <div className="info">Most visitors take the ferry service connecting the Vineyard and the mainland. The Steamship Authority makes more than 25 trips a day to Martha's Vineyard from Woods Hole during the summer season. It remains the only ferry transporting cars and passengers. </div>
			  <div className="info">So if you're bringing your car over to the island, plan to get to the Woods Hole terminal in Cape Cod, MA, at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure. Another important caveat to keep in mind, being the only car-ferry provider, the Steamship Authority service sells out even further in advance than the passenger-only ferries. Tickets for summer 2023 are already on sale!</div>
